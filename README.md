# DTC Plus
This repository will help users of all 'actual' programming languages interact with DTC in a human yet efficient manner. <br>
Promising high speeds through multi-threading and a udp like design we still promise that the api won't be horribly abissmle to use. <br>
<br>
Currently we are looking to implement the DTC standard for client and server as defined by sierrachart.com (dtcprotocol.org seems unavailable). <br>
Ontop of this standard we will also look to implement DTC extenstions, one of the more notable being the sierra chart 'non standard' extenstion. <br>
<br>
JSON encodings will probably come last and have worse support compared to the rest, i see little need to implement this for anything which isn't javascript or python. <br>
